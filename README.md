# 'Ello, mate! 👋 Welcome to me GitHub! 🚀  

## 🧐 Who’s This Geezer?  
Oi oi! The name’s Egemen, a right keen Data Science student in Dublin, Ireland, always on the hunt for new challenges an’ riddles to crack. Numbers? I talk to ‘em. Data? I make it sing. Python, R, SQL? Like a proper cuppa tea—can't start me day without ‘em!  

## 🔥 What’s Cookin’?  
- Doin’ all sorts of fancy stats, machine learnin’ an’ AI magic.  
- Got me mitts on Python, R, SQL, and a bit of Bash—cos why not?  
- Bit of an entrepreneur, always lookin’ to build summat clever.  
- Tryin’ to make sense of the world—one dataset at a time!  

## 🏆 Highlights, Innit?  
- Built predictive models that don’t just predict—they **know**.  
- Worked with real-world datasets, cleanin’ up the mess like a proper pro.  
- Always up for a bit of hackin' (the legal kind, mind ya).  

## 🎸 Fun Stuff  
When I ain't crunchin’ numbers, I’m strummin’ me guitar 🎸 or mixin’ up a cocktail or two 🍸 (yep, I moonlight as a bartender—multitaskin’ level 💯).  

## 📢 Wanna Chat?  
Fancy a chinwag about data, AI, or just life in general? Slide into me DMs or drop me a message on LinkedIn! Always up for a proper natter. Cheers! 🍻  

📌 **Fun fact:** I’m on a mission to master multiple disciplines—cos why settle for one, eh? 🚀
